        "abstract": "This paper introduces the use of single-layer and deep convolutional networks for remote sensing data analysis. Direct application to multi- and hyperspectral imagery of supervised (shallow or deep) convolutional networks is very challenging given the high input data dimensionality and the relatively small amount of available labeled data. Therefore, we propose the use of greedy layerwise unsupervised pretraining coupled with a highly efficient algorithm for unsupervised learning of sparse features. The algorithm is rooted on sparse representations and enforces both population and lifetime sparsity of the extracted features, simultaneously. We successfully illustrate the expressive power of the extracted representations in several scenarios: classification of aerial scenes, as well as land-use classification in very high resolution or land-cover classification from multi- and hyperspectral images. The proposed algorithm clearly outperforms standard principal component analysis (PCA) and its kernel counterpart (kPCA), as well as current state-of-the-art algorithms of aerial classification, while being extremely computationally efficient at learning representations of data. Results show that single-layer convolutional networks can extract powerful discriminative features only when the receptive field accounts for neighboring pixels and are preferred when the classification requires high resolution and detailed results. However, deep architectures significantly outperform single-layer variants, capturing increasing levels of abstraction and complexity throughout the feature hierarchy.",

        "abstract": "Satellite imagery has become widely available for detecting patterns by applying different deep learning and machine learning techniques to it. This paper will cover water monitoring, land cover and tree cover visualization. The main aim is to establish the effectiveness of ML and the insights provided by it to promote sound governance, better decision and policy making. Python libraries have been used extensively in Earth Observation applications and resources such as land-use patterns, crop-yield patterns, disaster control, and others. Majority of the data has been made available by Copernicus, World Bank's open data and Landsat programs. Various libraries that have been used are shapely, geopandas, rasterio, fiona, numpy, eo-learn, gdal, and s2cloudless. Detailed use of each of these libraries has been discussed in this paper. The process for analysis is as follows - defining region of interest, downloading satellite imagery, setting appropriate path to provide the algorithm (on jupyter notebook) access to the data, cloud masking, extract various features that are required according to objectives, fetch and save results. We have talked about satellite data, but another important aspect is ground- truth data to reference the results obtained from machine learning and deep learning algorithms. To increase the chances of successful prediction a series of steps are executed before drawing out the results including adding reference, sampling, merging features, postprocessing, and detection of changes. The performance majorly depends upon the distribution of data. It is usually a supervised technique. Recent developments have also provided us an option to fully automate the process, manually handle it or create a hybrid model.",

        "abstract": "The tremendous success of deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision provides a method for similar problems in the field of remote sensing. Although research on repurposing pretrained CNN to remote sensing tasks is emerging, the scarcity of labeled samples and the complexity of remote sensing imagery still pose challenges. We developed a knowledge-guided golf course detection approach using a CNN fine-tuned on temporally augmented data. The proposed approach is a combination of knowledge-driven region proposal, data-driven detection based on CNN, and knowledge-driven postprocessing. To confront data complexity, knowledge-derived cooccurrence, composition, and area-based rules are applied sequentially to propose candidate golf regions. To confront sample scarcity, we employed data augmentation in the temporal domain, which extracts samples from multitemporal images. The augmented samples were then used to fine-tune a pretrained CNN for golf detection. Finally, commission error was further suppressed by postprocessing. Experiments conducted on GF-1 imagery prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Image classification has been acquiring special importance in the practical applications of remote sensing. This is done with the extraordinary rise of spatial and spectral resolution of satellite imaging sensors. Also it comes from the daily increase of remote sensing databases. Deep learning approaches, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) techniques, have been recently outperforming other state-of-the-art classification approaches in various domains. In this chapter, we propose an enhanced technique for classification of satellite images using CNNs. There are two characteristics of satellite images that make performance issue very crucial; first, high information content within the satellite image, and secondly, high computational requisites involved by CNNs. The improvement technique is built on an effective selection of suitable image scale. As this scale achieves a respectively high classification accuracy alongside a minimal computational use. We conduct our proposed technique using three state-of-the-art datasets: WHU-RS Dataset, UCMerced Land Use Dataset, and Brazilian Coffee Scenes Dataset. The proposed technique results in enhancing the accuracy performance, instead of using the original scale directly.",

We show that a single encoding of satellite imagery can generalize across diverse prediction tasks (e.g., forest cover, house price, road length). Our method achieves accuracy competitive with deep neural networks at orders of magnitude lower computational cost, scales globally, delivers label super-resolution predictions, and facilitates characterizations of uncertainty. Since image encodings are shared across tasks, they can be centrally computed and distributed to unlimited researchers, who need only fit a linear regression to their own ground truth data in order to achieve state-of-the-art SIML performance.,",

        "abstract": "Object detection is a vital step in satellite imagery-based computer vision applications such as precision agriculture, urban planning and defense applications. In satellite imagery, object detection is a very complicated task due to various reasons including low pixel resolution of objects and detection of small objects in the large scale (a single satellite image taken by Digital Globe comprises over 240 million pixels) satellite images. Object detection in satellite images has many challenges such as class variations, multiple objects pose, high variance in object size, illumination and a dense background. This study aims to compare the performance of existing deep learning algorithms for object detection in satellite imagery. We created the dataset of satellite imagery to perform object detection using convolutional neural network-based frameworks such as faster RCNN (faster region-based convolutional neural network), YOLO (you only look once), SSD (single-shot detector) and SIMRDWN (satellite imagery multiscale rapid detection with windowed networks). In addition to that, we also performed an analysis of these approaches in terms of accuracy and speed using the developed dataset of satellite imagery. The results showed that SIMRDWN has an accuracy of 97% on high-resolution images, while Faster RCNN has an accuracy of 95.31% on the standard resolution (1000 \u00d7 600). YOLOv3 has an accuracy of 94.20% on standard resolution (416 \u00d7 416) while on the other hand SSD has an accuracy of 84.61% on standard resolution (300 \u00d7 300). When it comes to speed and efficiency, YOLO is the obvious leader. In real-time surveillance, SIMRDWN fails. When YOLO takes 170 to 190 milliseconds to perform a task, SIMRDWN takes 5 to 103 milliseconds.",
